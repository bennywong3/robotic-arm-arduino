# Robotic Arm Arduino Code
This is a fork of software for a [3D Printed Robot Arm](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1718984), modified to use servo gripper and BlueTooth module on Serial1. Some 3D printed models are also modified which can be found [here](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4364030).

The modified arm and the some base code are provided by HKU CS Makerlab, my job is to enchance the arm by **adding end-stop switches to the arm and add functions in Arduino code for auto-home positioning**.

With reference to the [base code from HKU CS Makerlab](https://github.com/hkucs-makerlab/robotArm) and the robotic arm [community firmware](https://github.com/20sffactory/community_robot_arm), this repo works with the HKU CS Makerlab customized robotic arm that supports auto-home positioning. Besides, operation range of the arm is also added by using the formula in community firmware.
